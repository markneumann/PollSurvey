#Rules:
1.You may use the exam code only ONCE. For retakes, use the manual unlock option or ask for a new exam code from your instructor.
2.You have 4.5 hours to work on the exam. Timer starts upon unlocking the exam.
3.If you notice that the newly unlocked belt exam option is the same as the previously unlocked exam to you, please inform your instructor and ask for a new exam code. Graders will not honor your work for previously unlocked exam.
4.Do not upload/commit your work on GitHub and other public file sharing sites. Other students may copy your code.
5. Make sure that the video demo is NOT set on public. You may set the password and include the video password information on your submission. Yellow Belt exam does not require video demonstration.
Upload your codes and paste your video link via Exam App.
When you encounter uploading problems or other issues with the app, DO NOT unlock another exam option. Please email remote-instructors@codingdojo.com and copy your instructor.
On manual unlock, you are only allowed to unlock another exam option 24 hours after you have unlocked a belt exam.
For concerns, please contact your instructor.
